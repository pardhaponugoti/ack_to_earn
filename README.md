## Overview

Welcome to Ack to Earn! This dapp allows web3 users to pay others to read messages sent to their wallets. It also incorporates ENS and Unstoppable Domains to allow them to be messaged with their usernames on those platforms.

_So it's just a messaging app? Why does it need to be on the ethereum chain?_

Great question! Ack to Earn forces the sender to pay the recipient a fee when they acknowledge a message they have been sent. This logic is built into a smart contract that handles the payment mechanisms.

_Why would anyone ever pay to send someone a message?_

Another great question! Funny enough, **this already happens**! Recruiters use products such as InMail, paying LinkedIn to message people on the platform. However, they don't have a guarantee that the recipient will read their message.

Rather than paying a platform like LinkedIn, why not pay the end user directly for their time? We think that people will be less likely to ignore your message since they're getting paid to read it. Moreover, with Ack to Earn, the sender only pays when the recipient actively acknowledges their message, otherwise the sender can reclaim their ether tied to the message.

_Ok, I think I get it but can you run that by me once more?_

Absolutely! With Ack to Earn, you can send someone a message and pay them when they acknowledge your message. We think this is better than traditional cold outreach because:

- The recipient is more likely to read a message they are getting paid to look at. They should be paid directly for their time, not a third party platform.
- The sender only pays when a recipient acknowledges their message. If the recipient doesn't acknowledge a message within 7 days the sender can reclaim their ETH. This means no wasted money on people who ignore your messages.
